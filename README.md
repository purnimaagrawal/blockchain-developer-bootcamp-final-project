# Blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

The Idea is to create Decentralized Airbnb. 

Workflow:
1) Property onwer can list the property 
2) Someone who wants to rent the property can place a new booking.
3) while placing the booking request , our Dapp will check if the property is available to rent for the dates or not .
4) funds will be send to the propoerty owner once booking has been confirmed .
