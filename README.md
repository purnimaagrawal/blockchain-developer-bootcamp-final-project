# Blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

Anybody who uses or have used airbnb knows that guests pays too much and hosts are paid too little ,with aribnb as platform keeps some amount from what guests pay for a booking in order to maximizw their profit and ensure their very survival. 
The Idea is to create Decentralized Airbnb. Home sharing is the ideal venue for a decentralized marketplace because travel is one of the world's biggest industries, and anyone with a home or a travel itinerary can participate. The underlying tech and infrastructure of blockchain is now scalable enough to accommodate the needs of such a marketplace. A decentralized platform for the home-sharing economy facilitating short and long-term stays .


Workflow:
1) Property onwer can list the property 
2) Someone who wants to rent the property can place a new booking.
3) while placing the booking request , our Dapp will check if the property is available to rent for the dates or not .
4) funds will be send to the propoerty owner once booking has been confirmed .
5) Traveller can query the property he has booked .

Future Implementation scopes : 
- Platform can have its own token that can be used to pay for the booking .
- platform can support other tokens as well .
- Special discounts can be provided when booked using platform native token .
- Reward system can be implemented . For example everytime a booking is completed , traveller can get back 2% of the total booking price back in his/her wallet .
- Can support booking cancellations and refunds . 
- Invite Program : User can refer friends and family and get rewarded for each referral .
- travel packages
- additional travel products like renting cars ,bus,transfers and other services.
- NFT ?
- Data analytics are applied to decentralised data stores in order to suggest optimal room rates based on comparable properties.
